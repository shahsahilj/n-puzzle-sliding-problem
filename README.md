# n-puzzle-sliding-problem
Solve the 8-puzzle for an n by n array (the n-puzzle)

Assumptions

1. The grid is an n × n array whose components are either numbers from the set {1, · · · , n × n − 1} and one
blank

2. The blank may be swapped with a component in one of the four directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT),
one move at a time.

3. The cost of moving from one configuration of the board (one node) to another is the same and equal to one.
Thus, the total cost of path is equal to the number of moves made from start to the goal position.

Algorithms used:

1. Breadth-First Search
2. Depth-First Search
3. A* Search
4. Iterative Deepening A* Search
